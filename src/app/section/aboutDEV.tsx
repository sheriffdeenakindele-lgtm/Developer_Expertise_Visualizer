                        The Developer Expertise Visualizer is a lightweight web application that presents developer contribution data from software projects in a clear and interactive way. It aims to demonstrate how metadata such as commit frequency and contribution areas can reveal the expertise of individual developers within a project. <br /><br />
                        This prototype supports the concept of a <strong>Developer Expertise Recommendation System</strong> â€” a research area focused on using project metadata to identify which developers are best suited for specific tasks or maintenance activities. The goal is to make software management more efficient by helping teams recognize who has worked most frequently on each component of a project.
